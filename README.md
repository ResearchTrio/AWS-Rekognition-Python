# AWS-Rekognition for Video Analytics Using Python
We here implement Advance Scene Detection Analytics across Edge and Cloud resources.The proposal uses AWS(Amazon Web Services) as a base platform for implementation.
It is an attempt to mimic the scenario described in the paper 
[Demonstration of a Cloud-based Software Framework for Video Analytics Application using Low-Cost IoT Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07680)

**The Salient Features of implementaion are :** 
* Known/Unknown Face Detection
* Animal Detection like Dog, Cat, Kangaroo etc.
* Unsafe Content Detection like Knife, Guns, Weapons.
* NoteWorthy Vehicle Detections like Ambulance, Fire Truck, Courier Vans (FedEx, DHL etc.)
